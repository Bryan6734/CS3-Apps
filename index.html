                <p>Hello! My name is <span>Bryan Sukidi.</span> I'm a junior studying at <span>Milton Academy,</span> a boarding school in New England. I was raised in Somerville, Massachusetts after my parents immigrated to the U.S. in 2003. After my father completed his studies, both of my parents returned to <span>Indonesia</span> to pursue work while my sister and I continue to study in America.</p>
                <p>Living independently has allowed me to explore some of my passions, meet some incredible thinkers, and reflect on what my contribution to the world will be. Right now, I'm interested in <span>computer science</span> and <span>social justice,</span> although I also enjoy conversations about politics, religion, literature, music, or anything else you might have to share.</p>
                <p>If you'd like to get into contact, feel free to email me at <span>bryan_sukidi24@milton.edu.</span> Thanks for reading!</p>
